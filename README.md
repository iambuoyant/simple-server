# Indego backend
Indego is Philadelphia's bike-sharing program, with many bike stations in the city. The [Indego GeoJSON station status API](https://www.rideindego.com/stations/json/) provides a realtime snapshot of
the number of bikes available, number of open docks available (not currently containing a bike), and total number of docks at every station. This API is free and requires no API key. The
[Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/current#name) provides a realtime snapshot of the current weather in a given city. Since Philadelphia is a small geographical area it is sufficient to
obtain the weather for a geographical location central to Philadelphia. This API has a free plan, you will need to sign up for an API key.
# About Project
